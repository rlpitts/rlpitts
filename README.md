### Hej! ğŸ‘‹

<!--I'm a postdoc at the Niels Bohr Institute. I specialize in observational (MIR to submm) studies of the earliest stages of high-mass star formation, with an increasing focus on astrochemistry. I got my Bachelors of Science (2) at Florida Tech, and my MS and PhD at University of Florida.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the PILS-Cygnus project (PI Lars E. Kristensen), a survey of 10 high-mass protostellar sources in Cygnus-x. Most of the team has been working on the line identification and chemistry of these objects, and I'm starting to get into that now, but up to now I've mostly handled the continuum aspect, fitting and modeling the physical conditions using NIR to submm data.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about chemical modeling and line radiative transfer. I've started to modify the PNAUTILUS chemical network based on a colleague's laboratory experiments, and I'm just starting to learn my way around line fitting in CASSIS.
