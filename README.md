### Hi/Hej! 👋👩‍🚀

I'm a postdoc at the Niels Bohr Institute. My specialty is observational (MIR to submm) studies of the earliest stages of high-mass star formation, with an increasing focus on astrochemistry. That said, for my age, I've dabbled in a lot of fields both scientific and artistic, so I'm more of a generalist; I like interdisciplinary projects.
I'm also a Florida native: I grew up and went to arts schools in Jacksonville, got my Bachelors of Science (2) at Florida Tech, and earned my MS and PhD at University of Florida. Denmark is pretty different climate-wise, but I love it here.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the PILS-Cygnus project (PI Lars E. Kristensen), a survey of 10 high-mass protostellar sources in Cygnus-x. Most of the team has been working on the line identification and chemistry of these objects, and I'm starting to get into that now, but up to now I've mostly handled the continuum aspect, fitting and modeling the physical conditions using NIR to submm data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about chemical modeling and line radiative transfer. I've started to modify the PNAUTILUS chemical network based on a colleague's laboratory experiments, and I'm just starting to learn my way around line fitting in CASSIS.
- 📈 I'm in the market for new postdocs, but I'm also seriously considering moving into the public or non-profit sector as a data scientist or a designer of educational and public outreach materials, hopefully on something related to monitoring/managing/reversing any of the various ongoing anthropogenic ecological disasters. And I'd really like to stay in the EU if possible.
